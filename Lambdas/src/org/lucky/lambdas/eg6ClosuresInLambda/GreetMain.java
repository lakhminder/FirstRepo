/**
 * A closure uses variables that are outside of the function scope. 
 * This is not a problem in traditional procedural programming – you just use the variable – 
 * but when you start producing functions at runtime it does become a problem
 * 
 * so in effect for using the variable outside scope or say inside lambda, 
 * it should be effectively final i.e it should/can't be modified
 * 
 * inner classes also deals in same way.
 * 
 * Though Java8/Lambdas are not real closures like in pure Functional Programming
 * as for this variables need to stored in heap instead of stack 
 * which is not a simple change keeping backward compatibility
