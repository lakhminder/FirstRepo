/**
 * @FunctionalInterface is optional but strongly recommended as to mark for other developer
 * as it can not allow to add any other abstract method.
 * 
 * For backward compatibility now interface can have default methods as well i.e method implementations
 * For eg foreach method have been added to each collection interface to provide support for lambdas 
 * and since to provide backward compatibility, its added as default(refer favorites/study).
 * 
 * So for Lambda/Functional interface are ones which has only one abstract method
